        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>I am a second year student, studying computer science at the University of Warwick. With a passion for building new and interesting things. </p>
        <p>Even from a young age I have created applications in whatever I had available to me: Scratch, Python; And I intend to keep innovating and striving for better quality and polish in my projects. </p>

        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>Recently, I worked on creating a two player fighting game as part of a game jam. We worked together as a team and used Unity and version control to produce our game. I was in charge of the creative design which included asset, tileset and sound design.</p>

        <p>Previously, I had made a terraria-esque game using the Pygame module, which proved to be quite a challenge as unlike unity all the physics must be done from scratch. This game included all the key elements required in an exploration game: procedural generation, mining, crafting, placing blocks, challenging enemy AI, a clear progression system and also a way to save progression.</p>
