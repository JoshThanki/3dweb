        <h2>Retro 2p fighting game</h2>
        <p>As part of a collaborative effort during a game jam, I played a pivotal role in the development of a two-player fighting game.

        <h2>Cardboard Minecraft</h2>
        <p>In a prior endeavor, I embarked on the creation of a Terraria-inspired game utilizing the Pygame module. This project presented unique challenges, as it demanded the manual implementation of physics, a stark contrast to the Unity engine. The game encompassed fundamental features such as procedural generation, mining, crafting, block placement, intricate enemy AI, a well-defined progression system, and save functionality.</p>
